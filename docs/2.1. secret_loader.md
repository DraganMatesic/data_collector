# 📦 Secret Loader Documentation

`secret_loader.py` is designed for use on personal development machines where GitHub CI/CD 
pipelines cannot safely set permanent environment variables. 
This script allows you to decrypt GitHub Secrets and write them to your system’s environment.

---

## 🔐 What It Does

- Downloads secrets from GitHub Actions as an encrypted `.zip` artifact
- Decrypts the file using a password (AES-256)
- Sets the secrets permanently as **user-level** environment variables:
  - ✅ On **Windows**: stored in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`
  - ✅ On **Linux/macOS**: appended to `~/.bashrc` or compatible shell config file

---

## ⚙️ When to Use It

Use this if:

- You want to work privately with your secrets without pushing them to cloud services
- You don’t want CI/CD to manage secrets automatically
- You're running everything from a personal desktop/laptop and need local setup

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
- Go to the GitHub page of this repository and click **Fork**
- Clone your forked version locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
```

### 2. Set Up the Project Locally
- Open the project in PyCharm or Visual Studio Code
- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Configure Secrets in Your Fork
- Go to your forked GitHub repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
- Click **New repository secret** and add each secret you want to load
- Add a `DC_SECRET_PASSWORD` secret — this will be used for encryption/decryption

### 4. Enable Workflows
- Go to the **Actions** tab of your fork
- Click **"I understand, enable workflows"**

### 5. Adjust the GitHub Action
- Open `.github/workflows/secrets_export.yml`
- Add `echo` lines for each secret you'd like to export:

```yaml
run: |
  echo "DB_USER=${{ secrets.DB_USER }}" >> secrets.env
  echo "DB_PASS=${{ secrets.DB_PASS }}" >> secrets.env
  echo "API_KEY=${{ secrets.API_KEY }}" >> secrets.env
```

### 6. Run the Export Workflow
- Trigger the **Export GitHub Secrets to AES-Encrypted ENV** workflow
- After it completes, download the artifact: `env-secrets-encrypted.zip`

---

### 7. Decrypt and Load Secrets Locally
1. Unzip the artifact to get `secrets.env.enc`
2. Open `secret_loader.py` in your IDE
3. At the bottom of the file, set the path to your `.zip` file (if needed)
4. Run the script:

```bash
python secret_loader.py
```

- The script will prompt for your decryption password or use the environment variable `DC_SECRET_PASSWORD`
- Environment variables will be applied permanently to your system user
- Restart your terminal or IDE to see the effects

---

## 🧪 Setup Requirements

### 🐍 Python packages
- `cryptography`

---

## ❗ Notes and Warnings

- Windows registry changes take effect **only in new terminals** unless a system broadcast is triggered (done automatically)
- Linux/macOS environment changes require restarting the terminal or running `source ~/.bashrc`
- Secrets are **not** copied when a repo is forked — forked projects must define their own secrets

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- If no variables appear after running `secret_loader.py`, make sure:
  - You used the correct decryption password
  - You downloaded and extracted the correct zip
  - You restarted your terminal after applying environment changes

---

## ✅ Done!
After this setup, your environment will have all secrets from GitHub Actions available locally — securely and permanently.
