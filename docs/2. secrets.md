# Secrets

In Data Collector, **secrets** are sensitive values managed through GitHub or the local environment. This includes usernames, passwords, API tokens, database credentials, and shared configuration values used across multiple applications.

Secrets are typically stored as **environment variables** at user scope. During settings initialization, Data Collector reads these variables to support secure and environment-specific configuration.

## Recommended Naming Convention

To keep secret names consistent across environments, use this format:

`DC_TARGET[_COUNTRY]_ALIAS_VARIABLE`

Naming components:

- `DC` — framework prefix (`Data Collector`)
- `TARGET` — secret target group (for example: `DB`)
- `COUNTRY` (optional) — three-letter country code (for example: `USA`, `CRO`, `SRB`)
- `ALIAS` — target alias (for example: `MAIN`)
- `VARIABLE` — variable name (for example: `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `SERVERNAME`)

### Naming Examples

- With country: `DC_DB_USA_MAIN_USERNAME`
- Without country: `DC_DB_MAIN_USERNAME`
