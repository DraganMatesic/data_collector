# About secrets
In the context of Data Colle ctor, **secrets** refer to sensitive values managed through GitHub or the 
local environment. This includes — but is not limited to — usernames, passwords, API tokens, 
database credentials, and other shared configuration values used across multiple apps within the framework.

Secrets are typically stored as **environment variables** on the user's system. 
When initializing specific settings, Data Collector retrieves the necessary values from these environment 
variables to ensure secure and dynamic configuration.

# Recommended Secret Naming Convention

To ensure clarity and consistency across environments, secrets in Data Collector should follow 
a structured naming format composed of the following parts:

- **DC** — Short for *Data Collector*
- **TARGET** — A short tag indicating the purpose of the secret (e.g., `DB` for database)
- **COUNTRY** *(optional)* — A three-letter country code (e.g., `USA`, `CRO`, `SRB`) indicating which region the variable applies to
- **ALIAS** — A unique identifier for the target (e.g., `MAIN` for the main database instance)
- **VARIABLE** — The specific variable name (e.g., `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `SERVERNAME`)

### 🧩 Naming Format Example
- Format: DC_TARGET[_COUNTRY]_ALIAS_VARIABLE
- With country: DC_DB_USA_MAIN_USERNAME
- Without country: DC_DB_MAIN_USERNAME

> 📘 See [3.settings.md](3.settings.md) for how environment variables are loaded and used in settings classes.

> 📘 See [2.1.secret_loader.md](2.1.secret_loader.md) for instructions on creating secrets in GitHub.
>  
> 🖥️ Alternatively, you can define them directly as **user environment variables** on your system.
