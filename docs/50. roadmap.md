## Guiding Principles for Development

1. **Each phase must be independently useful.** Phase 2 (orchestration) works without Phase 3 (scraping). Phase 3 works without Phase 2.
2. **Core framework is stable before extensions.** No refactoring the Database class while building scrapers.
3. **Documentation before code.** Feature specs are written and approved before implementation begins.
4. **Tests accompany every feature.** No phase is complete without integration tests.
5. **Backward compatibility within major versions.** Apps built on v0.1.0 must work on v0.5.0 without changes.
